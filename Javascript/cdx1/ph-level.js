// In chemistry, pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of a fluid.

// Create a ph-levels.js program that checks whether a pH level is basic, acidic, or neutral.

// First, create a variable called ph and give it a value between 0 and 14.

// Write an if/else if/else statement that:

// If ph is greater than 7, output “Basic”.
// Else if ph is less than 7, output “Acidic”.
// Else, output “Neutral”.

let ph = 7

if (ph > 7){
    console.log("Basic. Likely soap.")
}else if(ph < 7){
    console.log("Acdic. Likely acid.")
}else{
    console.log("Neutral. Like water.")
}
