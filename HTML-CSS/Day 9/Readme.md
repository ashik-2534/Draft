### ✅ **Task 1: Styled Profile Card**  

1. **HTML Structure Explanation**  
   - Create a container to hold the entire profile card. This serves as a wrapper for styling.  
   - Inside the container, include:  
     - A heading for the name.  
     - A paragraph for the bio.  
     - An image to represent the profile picture.  

2. **CSS Styling Instructions**  

   **Container Styling:**  
   - Apply a margin around the container to create space between it and other elements.  
   - Add padding inside the container to prevent content from touching the edges.  
   - Set the display property to `inline-block` to allow multiple cards to sit side by side while maintaining block-like styling.  
   - Apply a box shadow to give a lifted, card-like effect.  

   **Image Styling:**  
   - Use the `border` property to give the image a solid border.  
   - Add margin to separate the image from the text.  
   - Ensure the image fits well by controlling its width and height.  

   **Text Styling:**  
   - Use `font-size` to control the size of the name and bio.  
   - Apply `text-align` to center the content.  
   - Adjust `line-height` for better text spacing.

### ✅ **Task 2: CSS Layout Practice**  

1. **Heading Styling:**  
   - Use a block-level heading (like `<h1>`) to ensure it takes up the full width.  
   - Add a text shadow to make the heading visually stand out.  

2. **Image Styling:**  
   - Apply a border around the image to define its boundary.  
   - Add external margin to give space between the image and surrounding elements.  

3. **Link Styling:**  
   - Use inline-level elements (like `<a>`) to keep links on the same line.  
   - Apply padding to create inner spacing for better clickability.  
   - Separate the links using margin or another spacer.  

4. **Paragraph Styling:**  
   - Use internal CSS by placing styles within a `<style>` tag in the HTML.  
   - Apply basic text styling like `font-size`, `line-height`, and `color`.

### ✅ **Task 3: Button Styling**  

1. **Inline CSS Button:**  
   - Directly apply styles within the `style` attribute of the button tag.  
   - Set padding to make the button larger and easier to click.  
   - Add a border to define the button’s shape.  

2. **External CSS Button:**  
   - Define styles in a separate CSS file and link it to the HTML.  
   - Use padding and margin for spacing.  
   - Add a hover effect using the `:hover` pseudo-class to create a shadow when the mouse is over the button.

### ✅ **Task 4: Custom Info Box**  

1. **Info Box Structure:**  
   - Create a container to hold the title and description.  
   - Add multiple boxes to practice aligning them horizontally.  

2. **Styling Instructions:**  
   - Use the `inline-block` display property to allow horizontal alignment.  
   - Apply borders to visually separate each box.  
   - Use padding inside the box for internal spacing.  
   - Add a margin between boxes to prevent them from touching.
