Here’s a detailed, line-by-line text-based guide to master **condition statements**, **comparison operators**, and **logical operators**:

---

### ✅ **Task 1: Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero**

1. **Request Input from the User**  
   - Use a function to prompt the user to enter a number.  
   - Ensure the input is converted to a numerical format to allow comparisons.  

2. **Check if the Number is Positive**  
   - Use a condition statement to compare if the number is greater than zero.  
   - If true, prepare to display a message indicating it is positive.  

3. **Check if the Number is Negative**  
   - Use another condition to check if the number is less than zero.  
   - If true, prepare a message indicating it is negative.  

4. **Check if the Number is Zero**  
   - If neither condition above is true, assume the number is zero.  
   - Display a message confirming the number is zero.

### ✅ **Task 2: Compare Two Numbers**

1. **Take Two Inputs from the User**  
   - Prompt the user twice to input two numbers.  
   - Convert both inputs to a numerical format for comparison.  

2. **Compare if the Numbers are Equal**  
   - Use the equality comparison operator (`==`) to check if both numbers are the same.  
   - Display a message if the condition is true.  

3. **Check if the First Number is Larger**  
   - Use the greater-than operator (`>`) to check if the first number is larger.  
   - If true, prepare a message indicating that the first number is greater.  

4. **Check if the Second Number is Larger**  
   - Use the less-than operator (`<`) to check if the second number is larger.  
   - Display a message if the second number is greater.

### ✅ **Task 3: Determine Work Eligibility**

1. **Get the User’s Age**  
   - Ask the user to enter their age and convert the input into a number.  

2. **Check if the Age is within the Working Range**  
   - Use the `and` logical operator to verify if the age is between 18 and 60 (inclusive).  
   - If both conditions are true, display a message saying the user is eligible to work.  

3. **Check if the Age is Below 18**  
   - Use a condition to verify if the age is less than 18.  
   - If true, display a message indicating they are too young to work.  

4. **Check if the Age is Above 60**  
   - If the previous conditions fail, assume the age is greater than 60.  
   - Display a message saying the user is eligible for retirement.

### ✅ **Task 4: Validate a Password**

1. **Request a Password from the User**  
   - Prompt the user to enter a password.  

2. **Check the Length of the Password**  
   - Use a function to measure the length of the password.  
   - Ensure it is at least 8 characters long.  

3. **Check for Letters and Numbers**  
   - Use logical operators to confirm the password contains at least one letter and one number.  

4. **Display Validation Result**  
   - If both conditions are true, print a success message.  
   - Otherwise, display an error message suggesting a stronger password.

### ✅ **Task 5: Grade Calculation System**

1. **Accept a Student’s Exam Score**  
   - Prompt the user to input their exam score.  
   - Ensure the score is a number for accurate comparisons.  

2. **Assign Grade ‘A’ for Scores 90 and Above**  
   - Use a condition to check if the score is 90 or more.  
   - Display a message assigning grade ‘A’.  

3. **Assign Grade ‘B’ for Scores Between 80 and 89**  
   - Use a range check with `and` to verify if the score is between 80 and 89.  
   - Display a message assigning grade ‘B’.  

4. **Assign Grade ‘C’ for Scores Between 70 and 79**  
   - Use a similar range check for scores from 70 to 79.  
   - Display a message assigning grade ‘C’.  

5. **Assign Grade ‘F’ for Scores Below 70**  
   - If all previous conditions are false, assume the score is below 70.  
   - Display a message assigning grade ‘F’.

### ✅ **Task 6: Find the Largest of Three Numbers**

1. **Input Three Numbers**  
   - Prompt the user three times to input three numbers.  

2. **Check if the First Number is the Largest**  
   - Use `and` logical operators to check if the first number is greater than the other two.  
   - Display the first number if this condition is true.  

3. **Check if the Second Number is the Largest**  
   - Use similar conditions to compare the second number against the other two.  
   - Display the second number if it meets the criteria.  

4. **Check if the Third Number is the Largest**  
   - If the previous conditions are false, assume the third number is the largest.  
   - Display the third number as the largest value.
