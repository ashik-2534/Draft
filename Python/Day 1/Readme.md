2. **Print Each Variable**  
   - Display each variable’s value using a function that outputs information to the screen.  
3. **Check Output**  
   - Ensure each value appears correctly without errors.

### ✅ **Task 2: Swap Two Variables Without a Third Variable**

1. **Create Two Variables**  
   - Assign two different numbers to two variables.  
2. **Swap the Values**  
   - Use arithmetic operations (like addition and subtraction) or tuple unpacking to exchange their values.  
3. **Print After Swapping**  
   - Display the updated values to confirm the swap.

### ✅ **Task 3: Create and Print a List**

1. **Define a List**  
   - Create a list containing five of your favorite foods.  
2. **Loop Through the List**  
   - Use a structure that repeats actions to access and print each food.  
3. **Check Output**  
   - Verify each food item is printed on a separate line.

### ✅ **Task 4: Find Largest and Smallest in a List**

1. **Create a List of Numbers**  
   - Make a list with 10 different numbers.  
2. **Identify Extremes**  
   - Use built-in methods to find and store the largest and smallest numbers.  
3. **Display Results**  
   - Print both values with clear labels for clarity.

### ✅ **Task 5: Reverse a List Without Using `reverse()`**

1. **Create a List**  
   - Define a list with any values you like.  
2. **Manual Reversal**  
   - Access items in reverse order using list indexing and store them in a new list.  
3. **Output the Reversed List**  
   - Display the reversed version to check correctness.

### ✅ **Task 6: Access Items Using Positive and Negative Indexing**

1. **Define a List**  
   - Create a list with at least five elements.  
2. **Access by Positive Index**  
   - Retrieve and print the third item using its position from the front.  
3. **Access by Negative Index**  
   - Access the same item by counting from the back.

### ✅ **Task 7: Filter List Items by Condition**

1. **Create a List of Marks**  
   - Build a list representing student marks (e.g., 45, 67, 82, etc.).  
2. **Apply a Condition**  
   - Use a loop to check if each mark is greater than 80.  
3. **Output Valid Marks**  
   - Print only the marks that meet the condition.

### ✅ **Task 8: Update and Modify List Items**

1. **Create a List**  
   - Start with a list of at least three items.  
2. **Change an Item**  
   - Replace the second item with a new value using indexing.  
3. **Add and Remove Items**

### ✅ **Task 9: Remove Duplicates from a List**

1. **Create a List with Duplicates**  
   - Define a list containing some repeated items.  
2. **Filter Unique Items**  
   - Use a method that identifies and keeps only unique values.  
3. **Output the Cleaned List**  
   - Print the final list without duplicates.
